# Digit_Classifier
Digit classifier using MNIST  Neural Network frame

This Digit Classifier maps each input image to the correct numeric digit.The link to the dataset that has been used is as follows:
https://download.mlcc.google.com/mledu-datasets/mnist_train_small.csv

The appropriate labels and features have been parsed that allows the model to percieve the correct positions of pixellation and denote whether it is black,or white or gray.
The program uses to types of approach:1.Linear Classifier Model 2.A Neural Network Model using the DNN Classifier
The accuracy difference is also noted.
As we can percieve this is a task of multi-class classification that uses the one-to-many pathway.
